# WebScraping
This repo contains code , which was written to scrape data from a certain website.
To do so we have used python programming language and beautiful Soup .
Beautiful Soup is a library that makes it easy to scrape information from web pages. It sits atop an HTML or XML parser, providing Pythonic idioms for iterating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.
